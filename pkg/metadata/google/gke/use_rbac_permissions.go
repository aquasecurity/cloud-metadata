	Title:       "Legacy ABAC permissions are enabled.",
	Description: "You should disable Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), and instead use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in GKE.

RBAC has significant security advantages and is now stable in Kubernetes, so itâ€™s time to disable ABAC.",
	Impact:      "ABAC permissions are less secure than RBAC permissions",
	Severity:    "HIGH",
